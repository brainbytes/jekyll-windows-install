# Installing Jekyll on Windows (because it's special)

Assuming you already have Git installed, run the `install-jekyll.ps1` script from PowerShell
(running as administrator):

```
PS \your-website>prerequisites-windows
PS \your-website>jekyll serve
```

This will install Choco, Ruby, Jekyll, and a handfull of plug-ins we consider "standard". If 
something goes wrong, visit this [Jekyll on Windows page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/#installation)
and try the [Run Jekyll on Windows site](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/1-ruby-and-devkit/).
